Most Muddled Concepts:
Kevin Lai: The most muddled concept to me is how minimal a pure virtual function can be while still retaining 
its functionality. Also why a pure virtual function is denoted with = 0, since that doesn’t make any sense for 
a function definition.

Tanish Kumar: The most muddled concept to me right now is trying to create overridden functions in the shape 
class from the movable interface, in addition to differences in virtual from pure virtual functions. I 
understand syntax differences between them, but not practical differences.

Adham El Fawal: The most muddled concept for this lecture activity is how virtual functions work. It was a little 
hard to understand at first, but after listening to the lecture and testing it out during the lecture activity, 
I was able to understand it.

William Huang: I believe the most muddled concept about this lecture/lecture activity is with regards to how to 
specifically override certain aspects of inherited classes. It turned out that learning and understanding virtual 
functions is very fundamental to allowing us to efficiently learn to override functions and variables in inherited
classes.

Wesley Kam: The most muddled concept was trying to override the set color from shape properly. At first we didn’t 
make the function virtual so it would prioritize the setColor in shape rather than the specific shape types. After 
playing around with the code, however, we figured out that we just had to put virtual in front to prioritize the 
setColors in the child classes.

Aaditya Channabasappa: The most muddled concept for me is about the different uses of pure virtual over a normal 
virtual. Pure virtual is used so that the child classes create that function, but are there wouldn’t it be more 
practical to have the parent class do something for that function rather than nothing.
